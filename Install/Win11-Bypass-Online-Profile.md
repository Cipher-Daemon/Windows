# Bypass online account requirement during install

After you install Windows 11 when you get to the language selection screen press the following keys on the keyboard to open CMD:

```
SHIFT + F10
```

When a CMD window pops up type the following

When you press enter it'll reboot and go back to the OOBE screen and it wont require you to use a MS/Online account to setup Windows.
