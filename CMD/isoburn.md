## Thanks to Windows 11 they make it a pain to burn an ISO to a CD/DVD, as of writing (March 2023) its completely removed from the context menu if you right click on an ISO file and attempt to burn it. This is all thanks to all machines nowadays not having a DVD drive in them. Heres a way to get back the classic burning of an ISO


### How to burn nowadays?

Find the ISO that you are trying to burn and open a CMD/Powershell window in the same directory.

```
isoburn.exe SomeOS.iso
```

After that you are presented to choose a drive to burn it with and optionally but highly recommended to check "Verify disk after burning".

After the burn, enjoy using that CD/DVD.
